  Rate Limiter with Gin Framework

## ðŸ’» Project Description

The rate limiter is a project that aims to present concurrency and parallelism so that the mutex is used to control processes/requests. The general idea is to keep the application in a locked state while the IP storage and manipulation process is carried out to control requests within a certain time interval, a strategy to promote resilience.
